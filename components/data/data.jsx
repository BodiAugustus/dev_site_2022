    content: "BTC and ETH rising is not so surprising. It is a lot like the last emissions of a dying ember before it cools to ash. The only reason I can give to why these two dinosaurs continue to receive the breath of live is because they have been deemed 'Too Big To Fail,' by those who stand to lose amazing amounts of money if it continues to slide so quickly back into mediocrity. After all of the ETF's, the wall street listings, the exchanges, the nations (El Salvador), the money, the hype and all the rest the institutional investors and hedge fund managers need to avoid a free fall since they would stand to lose hundreds of billions of dollars - remember when wall street stepped in and had RobinHood suspend trading for AMC/GameStop when consumers were causing a run on the stock??? This is the same same but different. I predict that BTC and ETH will get pumped back up to a suitable level for the institutional investors and nation states to recoup any losses before they themselves pull the plug and send BTC falling precipitously along with ETH back to 5 and 3 figures each respectively. This event would pull the entire market down for a significant period - a month to many - as well as may be used as a cudgel to change the people's sentiment surrounding crypto for good so that the governments then have a mandate to come in and regulate it into oblivion Thus the people, like with COVID, continue to scream for their own enslavement.Time will tell but as always you should, DYOR"
