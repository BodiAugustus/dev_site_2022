      "Good day for the markets! Unless you hold BTC/ETH... Well, anything to be fair. However, this is much, much better than having BTC/ETH slowly rot and erode away like two whales on a beach whose stench keeps away all the swimmers. Down to 1.7 trillion - nice. I could not see the market going under 1, though I'm no oracle. All I know is, the sooner BTC/ETH finish bleeding out, the better for crypto as an industry. Competition is what drives innovation and the innovation occurred since ETH and BTC were the only shows in town as left them both in the POW scheme dust. Understand, BTC/ETH will not DIE. No way. Not because they are too big to fail either - though they are to fail overnight, which is why I am stoked about this 13% loss in an afternoon. That is good for the recovery speed - so long as BTC/ETH do not try to flop around at their current prices for more weeks. BTC/ETH do have layering/scaling solutions and they do have tremendous infrastructure and resources and they do have network effect and much more - they will adapt and survive, they just will not survive as they had been, ruling the tote pole from on high. It will be a much more equal playing field now and BTC/ETH need to catch up. Exciting times in the space but as always you should DYOR!",

      "BTC/ETH continue to fall after being artificially supported for a bit. Lots of big wigs stand to lose catastrophically so they can't let the two tank over night. They will both continue to fall, probably as they have been, clunky and shaky, as the hedge funds and big investors get out. This is going to pull down the entire market, as you see and have seen happening. The current market is 1.9 trillion down from over 3 and could go below 1 as BTC/ETH lose out and confidence sours by those who lose big because they thought BTC/ETH were the digital gold/silver everyone said they were (myself included a few years past before I got into the nuts and bolts of things). Short term I would not invest in new projects but would instead prepare and do research on the projects which I felt were the best so that when the bottom hits you can stock up at bargain prices and ride the new, diverisfied ecosystem back to the moon. Look, DeFi, crypto, encryption, PGP, it IS the future. Digital currencies ARE the future. The US government announced TODAY they are planning on creating their own digital currency and are open to 90 days of public remarks on the matter. Right now things will get ugly as BTC/ETH pull the rest down but when the flippening occurs and those trillions come back in the opportunities will be incredible. You would do well to research POS blockchains, decentralized oracles, metaverses, and privacy coins/chains. Investing in projects like these will do you very well when the investments come back in after the dust has settled from the current demolitions underway. Find your projects, research them, understand their real world use cases and who they have a niche, and wait for the storm to pass. Currently BTC/ETH are still WAY overpriced so I would not expect the down trend to stop... BTC should be thousands per coin, if that, and honestly, I wouldn't even pay $100 for ETH. Good news is, the flippening will occur before either BTC/ETH reach THAT low. I do not know at what level they will have to reach before the market moves past them but they will need to go down more from what they are currently, of that I feel sure. As always though you should, DYOR.",

      'Interesting developments with scaling solutions underway for BTC and ETH but will it be enough or too little too late? Meanwhile outflow continues to occur from all projects as BTC/ETH continue to pull the market lower towards the flippening point. The sooner this occurs, the better for the alternative solutions to each, such as XMR for BTC and any number of chains for ETH. Twitter feed shows more and more people awake and shouting at the inherent weaknesses and flaws, less maxis, more resistance. Trends look bullish for competitors once the two first iterations wind down enough. When you consider ETH and BTC valuated to hundreds of billions each, it seems ridiculous to sell when your 8 bill project falls to six or even one honestly. All the outflow is in response to BTC/ETH but when the point is reached then it will no longer matter what the price actions of BTC/ETH are because the ecosystem will have diversified well beyond them. Short term to next few months could see deep red, there is little reason for BTC/ETH to not continue falling much further. DYOR.',

      "LUNA is a legit project running on the Terra blockchain which utilizes profits from a real world South Korean based online marketplace where a percentage of each purchase is sequestered for use as collateral in the Terra ecosystem. Currently most people who utilize Luna do so using the Mirror or Anchor Protocol (depending on who you speak with) which is a LUNA based platform that allows for you to import LUNA and bond it for an equivalent amount of bonded Luna, otherwise known as bLUNA.Once you have collateralized your bLUNA you can do go multiple routes but one of the most common is to take out a loan on your bLUNA and use that loan to purchase more bLUNA. So if you deposited $5000 and are earning %20 APY (the standard guaranteed rate for deposits) then you could take out up to another $3500 and invest that on top of your initial investment. This of course allows you to earn both interest and yields in the form of Anchor (ANC) coins which can be used to pay down your loan so that before the loan is paid off in full from dividends accrued alone - this is assuming of course that the system continues to grow. You will perhaps recall during May when China banned crypto that Luna which had been at .50 cents went from $20 down to $7. During this time many people who had loans out went over the threshold for collateralized loans and so were liquidated. To avoid this you can simply not take out loans or take out smaller loans that are well below the threshold so you can have time to make adjustment during times of market volatility.Beyond that you can also stake bLUNA into the ANC vault where yields are generally much higher, again paid out in ANC. The ANC can be immediately traded for bLUNA or for LUNA's stable coin. UST. UST is one of the big growth drivers behind the Terra ecosystem. All in all Terra/LUNA is a great project - I did not even touch on their other protocol which allows for you to get access to blue chip stocks like Microsoft and Tesla - allowing you to invest in normal stocks using UST - it is beyond the scope of beginners however 🙂. The reasons I do not currently advise investments into Terra/LUNA as as follows: 1) It has already valuated a great deal in a short time and so further large evaluations are unlikely in the near term. 2) Transaction fees are .25 cents per transaction. It takes many transactions to accomplish simple task and so this quickly adds up to the same or more than you would spend with a bank. 3) The Terra ecosystem is currently much less interoperable with other blockchains, though that it being worked on currently.4) The real deal breaker is the lock up policy. Once you deposit your LUNA for bLUNA inside the protocol those funds are locked away for 21 days from the time you click withdrawal. Having to wait 21 days to withdrawal your funds is very risky and not at all free which decentralized finance is supposed to be built around. 5) Other lower MC projects with similar or larger ecosystems will attract larger capital which will slow the evaluation of Terra. All in all I say sell or look elsewhere. Short term LUNA has made it's bull run. Look to smaller MC competitors like ATOM, NEAR or FTM to get better returns with more freedom of use. DYOR.",

      "BTC and ETH rising is not so surprising. It is a lot like the last emissions of a dying ember before it cools to ash. One narrative I can give to why these two dinosaurs continue to receive the breath of live is because they have been deemed 'Too Big To Fail,' by those who stand to lose amazing amounts of money if it continues to slide so quickly back into mediocrity. After all of the ETF's, the wall street listings, the exchanges, the nations (El Salvador), the money, the hype and all of the rest, the institutional investors and hedge fund managers need to avoid a free fall since they would stand to lose hundreds of billions of dollars - remember when wall street stepped in and had RobinHood suspend trading for AMC/GameStop when consumers were causing a run on the stock??? This is the same same but different. I predict that BTC and ETH will get pumped back up to a suitable level for the institutional investors and nation states to recoup any losses before they themselves pull the plug and send BTC falling precipitously along with ETH back to 5 and 3 figures each respectively.  This event would pull the entire market down for a significant period - a month to many - as well as may be used as a cudgel to change the people's sentiment surrounding crypto for good so that the governments can then have a mandate to come in and regulate it into oblivion. Time will tell but as always you should,  DYOR.",

      "Currently I hold Monero without plans to sell. Majority stake is invested on SpiritSwap where I have 1/2 FTM and 1/2 SPIRIT in the boosted farms where I earn yields in SPIRIT which I then trade for ZOO and hold until it rises up. Then will liquidate the ZOO into either more FTM/SPIRIT if the getting is good or otherwise start funneling into another project. My strategy is very low maintenance and easy. Set it and forget it mostly. You can do much more involved strategies however! Before you do though, you should always DYOR. FTM/SPIRIT/ZOO will do big things though, mark this post but don't make ZOO - ZOO is a likely but depends on how the NFT market holds up. If NFT's stay big, ZOO will go big. Anyway, I am buying ZOO with free dividends off my FTM/SPIRIT farm so it does not cost anything. I used to reinvest into the SPIRIT/FTM pool but I have a good amount of both now and so diversify. Once I cash in on either project my long term belief is in Monero.",

      'Given how long it took BTC to rise, along with the huge array of investors and investments made plus the frameworks and additions built on top (such as lightening network) mean that BTC will not drop over night. Even now the analyst are comparing POW vs POS schemes and looking at competitors to BTC and thus you see a large outflow. Many will cling to the sinking ship however, especially the maxis. They will ensure that BTC does not sink like the Titanic.  The same way DOGE coin went up to 79 cents (lol) and has slowly and this many months fell back lower and lower as fewer zealots remain is how I expect BTC/ETH to fall. Neither will die mind you. They both have too much money and too many backers behind them. They will never be the titans they once were though. Eventually in the not so distant future they will just be another in a long list of digital assets and for the quick amongst us, they already are. Expect BTC/ETH prices to continue to fall which will continue to decrease market prices of most assets, though, to lesser and lesser effect as time goes on until the flippening event - the moment when the public/investors see crypto as more than BTC/ETH and begin to reinvest in what will be the final wave to mass adoption which is sure to come. This year, next at latest.  Position yourselves well and you should have no worries. DYOR.',

      'The faster BTC/ETH fall, the sooner the others will rise. Falling from 1.2 trillion to 700 trillion is a big deal. From 550 billion to 350 billion a big deal. Falling from 7 billion to 5 billion? Even if it fell to 2 or 3 billion, so what? As soon as the dust settles that 2 billion will become at least 20 and perhaps 40, 50 or even more - this year. It is GOOD NEWS that BTC and ETH are falling this quick. A slow death would have meant long times for evaluations. This quick passing means tons of capital will be looking for new similar projects with better upside to invest in and THAT is where the competing blockchains to ETH come in, the competing coins to Bitcoin (like Monero) come in, and where the NEW ideas like Metaverse begin to take hold and take shape. 2022 will be huge for crypto.

As BTC and ETH market shares continue to shrink and others grow, the entire market will achieve a new level of stability that is not possible when an entire industry rest on the day to day activities of a single or even two projects. Projects devaluing short term will, if they are not 💩, valuate much higher after the dust settles from this current fall from grace. With low MC projects and literally a trillion dollars ready to come back in (high of market when BTC was ATH was 3 trillion+, currently at 2 trillion) that means that those other projects will start evaluating much higher as multiple new heads begin to emerge from the medusa. Short-term probably will remain as is or free-fall down to the bottom of BTC, wherever that may be. However you are not in risk of losing your wealth unless you need to sell quickly or unless you are holding BTC/ETH or holding 💩 coins. Otherwise, whenever the bottom is reached, the funds will pour back into the ecosystem from a much larger faucet than before.Before the faucet went all into bitcoin which filled up and overflowed into ETH which eventually filled up (around $4000 mark) and then started to overflow into the rest as we have seen these past months.Now however the pour will be much more dispersed which means a lot of cups becoming a lot more full much faster. Just got to hang on and enjoy the ride! DYOR.",

SOL, ADA will increase but it will take much more to make appreciable profits because their mc is so high. Same with the rest excepting ATOM, NEAR and FTM. Those three are your best low MC seriously vetted and built upon blockchains which will see, along with the aforementioned, tremendous growth in 2022.

      "It's like the world suddenly woke up to the truth - BTC/ETH are way overvalued. Look at the past seven days, for ETH and BTC is even worse. ETH is on it's way down while FTM during this entire bleed out has been absorbing ETH losses along with ATOM and NEAR and is poised for a breakout. Even JP Morgan just down casted Ethereum's projected dominance when it was reported, for the nth time, that the long awaited upgrades were pushed back to NEXT year (2023).  No one except the already wealthy would continue to prop up Ethereum and Bitcoin using ridiculously expensive and antiquated POW schemes when so many better and more efficient competitors can carry the same amount of transactions for a fraction of the cross at a much faster rate. BTC/ETH are not dead, they will not die, but their unchallenged dominance as the supreme beings of the crypto space is clearly coming to an end which is why I am stoked for the months ahead as all of those hundreds of billions get reallocated into the next generation projects such as what I am in and have been pining about for months. I use much of these platforms and chains - I will give a writeup on why Luna is outclassed by compeitors next and yet look at that 40+ billion MC despite have 21 day lockups on all bonded bLUNA's deposited into the terra ecosystem, not to mention 25 cents PER transaction, regardless of the transaction type. I know that sounds good but it adds up to dollars fast and why spend dollars when on Fantom you can do the same thing (and AVAX) for fractions of a CENT and WITHOUT having to keep your wealth LOCKED away for 21 days? So if the market crashes or your wife has an accident and you need your money fast, don't look at Luna. It will be 21 days before you gain access to your funds to withdraw them. Could you imagine waiting 3 weeks for a withdraw?  Luna is also over hyped and over priced for those reasons alone.  DYOR.",

That means it did more buisness than Terra, Solana, Polkadot, Cardano, Avalanche, Cosmos, and Near. I have been in this space since 2017. FTM is prime for the big leagues and SPIRIT will get pulled up all the way to the bank, lol, just kidding, we don't have those in DeFi. Just more antiquated technology that's on its way out.

With a MC of 7 billion and 55 million respectively, each of these projects should continue to evaluate to the same levels as their more heavyweight counterparts like LUNA/ANC or AVAX/???.  As a user of multiple blockchains I am coming from a user experience perspective. I would recommend FTM over LUNA everyday of the week and look at where it is at. Have not used AVAX but DOT is at least the same only with less dAPPs and much less in daily TX volume despite a 4.5X higher MC. Fast falls always come with pullback but crypto will continue its invasion in 2022 and FTM/SPIRIT will rise high in the coming totem. ATH for FTM was $3.63 which was around 8.5 billion MC - I am looking to 20+ billion before I liquidate any FTM. SPIRIT ATH was about .66 cents. If FTM increases, SPIRIT does too and so as long as FTM is on the monthly increase I will stay into SPIRIT. Right now $1 is the target but honestly, with a sub 60 million dollar market cap? It can easily become 2-3$ per SPIRIT this year as FTM pushes 20 billion MC and higher.  Ethereum investors and newbies alike will be looking for a place to make profit and right now there are few other blockchain project in the top 10 that look better for what it has at current market value. As always you should DYOR but FTM/SPIRIT is a winner for now. Will post about if that starts to change but there is no reason in the short term to believe it will barring a meltdown of the crypto space if the slow bleed out from ETH and BTC becomes a sudden torrent. At that point it may be best to liquidate your holdings into stables and ride the coaster back down to bottom, then buy back in low.  However, barring that things remain to GROW as they should given the monetary policies of world governments and increasing digitization of our economies (metaverse, web3, ect), then FTM/SPIRIT, I believe, will perform extremely well this year, and so far, already have.

      "Oracles are layer 2 solutions built on top of the blockchain which allows for real world updates of data to be fed into the closed blockchains because layer 1 blockchains cannot make API calls - basically they can't reach outside themselves into the real world for updates on events and activities, like the changing price of ETH/USD. So the Oracles built on top of the blockchains are able to be the conduit from which information (data) is passed from the ever changing real world into the finite coded smart contracts which are running on the chain. Oracle networks can make assumptions on outside changes such as political upheavals and how they are/may affect prices of oil or used cars or the minute-by-minute changes in the real-world-value of currencies stacked against each other. Centralized oracles allow for a single point of failure - the purpose of the blockchain is to survive so long as a single node is still online. By having only a single entity, that entity can in essence flip a switch and restrict our freedom to interact. Data is also required from outside sources for many reasons of which you can easily imagine, such as a grain shortage affecting the price in Lira and how that impacts the price of X Y and Z. Layer one blockchains do not have that ability to pull outside data in order to make updates. ChainLink is (LINK) is an example of a decentralized oracle network that allows for outside data and computations in a manner which is highly decentralized manner with near instant customization in the node count. ChainLink offers real time price feeds at data.chain.link where the decentralized oracle is accessing real world data in real time and running it through algorithms constantly to output the most accurate real time price of these currencies - these are how sites like Binance and Kraken and KuKoin all get their token prices which are displayed across their UI (your screen). There are many decentralized oracles returning different price feeds so that there is not any one single point of failure and by having a consensus of non-related oracles all reaching the same conclusions on real-time price help ensure the accuracy of the data presented to you, the user. So you can be sure that the price of MANA or XMR is the most current price - whether you are a buyer or setting up your own platforms on the decentralized web.  You can also make your own API and do everything yourself, however there is really no reason to reinvent the wheel when it is already so beautifully crafted and easy to integrate.

      "BTC and ETH use Proof of Work (POW) algorithms to find the nonce number which wins them the reward of the block plus all gas fees paid into it. This type of algorithm uses enormous amounts of electricity as every node races at full speed to unlock the correct nonce first. Further, Ethereum and the other layer 1 chains only consist of a single blockchain. This means in times of heavy congestion (market swings) the gas fees can shoot up to very high amounts of money because you are competing with so many other transactions to get selected to a block (have your transaction carried out). Layer two solutions create multi chains where a central chain has other separate chains which attach on to it and that it controls and keeps track of. This is analogous to the difference between starch and amylopectin but I digress - the point is more chains means that in times of high volatility there will still be lots of room for the congestion to spread out into preventing gas fees from increasing. Lastly - the other major blockchains (ETH killers) like LUNA, AVAX, DOT, FTM, ect. they are all Proof of Stake (POS) algorithm based. This system calls on random nodes to propose a new nonce number which the other nodes all validate and agree was constructed according to the rules of nonce creation. To prevent them from breaking the rules, every node has to put up money, or stake, in order to participate and if they are caught breaking the rules they are fined or removed as a node. This prevents the need for each node to race against the others as the nodes are still rewarded for their validations and also keeps them honest since each node has to put up real value to participate.  This method of blockchain lowers energy usage but over 99% compared to the antiquated POW models employed by BTC and ETH. So far as Lightning network or Ethereum 2.0 - they are abstractions built upon rickety foundations. Ethereum 2.0 was supposed to be released in 2019 and it was most recently pushed back again to June of 2022. By that time what do you think the market cap of FTM will be? Of Avax? Of Cosmos?  Don't invest your money in bad tech - BTC and ETH are bad tech at this point. ETH and BTC cannot compete as they are now - they are surviving off network effect alone and will continue to bleed out to their younger more efficient competition. By the way, Ethereum 2.0 is going to POS model as well. They are copying what their competitors are doing. That really tells you all you need to know. DYOR.",

      "When people ask me what's the best safe crypto investment that isn't already overpriced I tell them Fantom. Even 3 months ago at $3.63 it was overpriced. With Luna and AVAX both pushing 30 billion and FTM faster and cheaper than both, my money (literally) is on FTM for the foreseeable future. Currently barely at 4 billion MC yet is easily a times 10 from that. Does not do a lot of US marketing and growth has been mostly organic but FTM should see $5 within the short term and it could easily reach $10 in 2022 as well - though >$10 is asking for a lot. Still, SpiritSwap which is FTM's 2nd largest DEX is a steal right now at .13 per SPIRIT. This is also a Pancake swap waiting to happen. Current marketcap is 40 MILLION. 2022 can see it easily 10X that which would put SPIRITS well over $1 each - this is where the biggest gains can be hard. SPOOKY swap as well but I think SPIRIT is going to win out between them. SPOOKY started first and built a lead and it does have the higher marketcap however the platform on SPIRIT is much cleaner and more UI friendly - the whole setup - and if you look at their Twitter profiles, SpirtiSwap is only 3000 followers behind SpookySwap now. In the next few months they will surpass Spooky and Spooky will see increased outflows into SPIRIT. So I am really bullish on FTM/SPIRIT for 2022 like I was ETH for 2021 and like I was BTC for 2017-2020. In the short term, depending on how Bitcoin and Ethereum bleed out, their could be a large crash and so it MAY not be the best time to buy - no one knows. If however Ethereum and Bitcoin continue to bleed out slowly like they have been these past few weeks, then the prices should remain generally stable until the run up occurs as the hundreds of billions outflow from BTC and ETH to find new profit makers and they pile into FTM/SPIRIT. If you did not make money on Bitcoin or Ethereum, it's still not too late to turn $1000 into $10000 but as always you should DYOR. I always love Monero as well and it MAY have a breakout year in 2022 depending on how Bitcoin fares. I am not bullish on XMR for more than X1.5-3X profits whereas FTM and SPIRIT I think X5 or X10 or even higher will occur within the next year.",

      "If your investment is Bitcoin and you bought it recently then you may very well be out some cash. Same with Ethereum over $4000. There is no reason for Bitcoin or Ethereum to go back up, let alone stay where they are. Thus short-term to a few months out I would expect a general reshifting in the space where funds are reallocated away from BTC and ETH into other project. This means in the very near future there will most likely be more heavy dips in the overall market as Bitcoin and ETH continue to be shaken out and most investor's don't know anything m ore than those one trick ponies. However, if you are invested in a solid project, like LUNA or DOT or even FTM and especially Monero (I'm partial there), then you would do well to sit where you are and let the others panic sell because when the reshuffle commences and all those hundreds of billions from BTC and ETH need a new place to call home then your little 5,10, or even 50 Billion MC projects with high upside will look mighty inviting and those losses you would earn if you sell today would be profits if you held until then.

FTM can go from 3 billion current MC to 30 billion MC EASY during the next calendar year and there is very little reason why it should not, as an example. If you are in BTC or ETH, perhaps consider leaving for a younger and more up-to-date counterpart 😉. Now is a great time to buy and to hold, unless you are buying BTC or ETH or one of the many thousands of outright scams or 💩 show projects out there today - remember, the first 100 listings on CoinGecko are at the very least legit and the ones near the end have very low MC which can do 10, 50 or 100X gains in the next year as the great crypto reshuffle shakes itself out.

      "Gas is required to run functions which result in changes to the blockchain, such as a transfer function which sends Ether from one person to another. On the Ethereum blockchain this sort of transfer transaction has a set price for gas which is 20 billion wei. Other types of interactions/transactions have different set prices depending on many parameters. 1 wei = 1 wei 1 Gwei = 1 billion wei 1 Ethereum = 10^18 wei. So you wanting to transfer some Ethereum to X will make the gas price 21000 Gwei because it is a transfer transaction. Now, depending on the network congestion it will take more or less gas in order to get your transaction picked up from the transaction pool by the block miners and written onto the block. The price of gas will remain the same, but how much you need to fulfill the transaction will depend on the network congestion and how fast you need it to go through. So you set your Gas Limit (pay a transaction fee) which will determine HOW MUCH of that 21000 Gwei gas you are willing to purchase to get your transaction through.  Paying less money means your transaction takes more time and if it is not enough then the transaction may be left in the pool entirely and stay unwritten to the block until the transaction fails which eats up all of your gas fees and then reverts back whatever transaction you just tried to do after the loss of said fees. I.E. you are back at square one only you lost your gas money too. Paying more money means that your transaction has a higher probability of being picked by the miners and added to the next block with less chance of failure. Why should you care though? Why should you put more than the minimum? If you are making trades at set prices then setting low to mid-level gas fees means that you end up purchasing or selling a coin for example at a potentially much different price point than when you initiated the transaction. For some traders, seconds can be the difference between fortunes and bankruptcy and minutes are an eternity when a price ticker is falling or rising fast. Fifteen minute transaction confirmation times are brutal and the worst is a long transaction time followed by a failed (reverted) transaction which puts you back at square one again but without the gas which you lost and now back on the clock as well. So then the best strategy is to pay a mid amount if you are making regular trades/transactions in times of non-high volatility or congestion, or, if you are making important trades during high volume, to pay above the market cost for gas to ensure your transactions get picked first by the miners and added into the blockchain to be confirmed. So, in following our example of a simple transfer on the Ethereum blockchain with a set gas price of 21000 Gwei you have a has range of 37 Gwei on the low end to 52 for high at this particular time of day. Sometimes during high volumes the gas can be higher than 200 Gwei. The difference in that 15 Gwei between 37 and 52 is the difference between a 1 to three minute transaction time versus a 10+ minute transaction time. So you opt for 53 Gwei in gas. Wrapping this up, to calculate your cost in ETH for this transaction you would simply multiply the gas price by the gas limit - or 21000 * 53 = 1,112,047.925000 Gwei. Remember 1 Gwei is 1 billion wei. To convert into Ethereum just count 9 decimal places to the left on Gwei - so the cost for this transaction in Ethereum would be apx 0.0011120047... Ethereum or about $4.50 USD at current ETH prices ($4100 USD). The same transaction on the Fantom blockchain would cost .001 USD and take between 1-2 seconds. Now you look at Ethereum with a market cap at 500 billion and you ask yourself how can LUNA or FTM or AVAX or the rest NOT become 100+ billion market cap projects in the next year or two (FTM currently 6 billion)? That's what I'm asking too. That’s why anyone who knows and is not a maxi is wondering louder by the day. Why waste so much time and money on a product just because? That's called the network effect and that is why Ethereum is still doing so well compared to other blockchains which do what Ethereum does much cheaper, faster and with way less energy. P.S. - I told a few people who asked me this time last year what they should invest in for 2021. I told them put all their money into Ethereum and leave it there. Well look at the price of ETH last November and now. When those same people and their friends ask me this year, as a few already have, I will tell them to put their money into one of the top 10 block chains that IS NOT Ethereum, and come back next Thanksgiving. It really can be that easy. Remember - it takes multiple transactions to buy and swap coins on the blockchain. When using Ethereum or Fantom going to a token swap like Uniswap or SpiritSwap will take one transaction to give wallet permission, one transaction to purchase the token, one transaction to gain access to the liquidity pools, one transaction to add into those liquidity pools to begin earning yields, and then more transactions to exit the pools or swap into stable coins during downturns or to send to offline wallets for better storage. The transactions add up very quickly and so do the fees which is why the next gen solutions are such a strong investment for 2022. Even LUNA with its .25 transaction fees is quite high compared to AVAX or FTM or POLY or the like which are magnitudes cheaper and with greater interoperability between chains.  As always, DYOR!",

      "FOMO = Money go down. Jumping into projects you don't understand because other(s) shill you on Twitter/FB/Discord/Telegram/ect. or CoinGecko shows you 100% or even 200% increases in a week, sometimes a day, will only leave you wrekt in the long run. This ESPECIALLY includes IPO's and newly launched projects. Example 1: The day before PolyFox launched on Matic, now Polygon's blockchain, there was tremendous hype and fanfare, especially on Twitter and the Discord chats. There is ALWAYS that hype because there are always sharks who got in early ready to dump on the incoming minnows who think they are right on time. In the case of PolyFox, they launched with only a single PolyFox token which went for tens of thousands of dollars and the farming yields were in the thousands of percent awarding these super scarce PolyFox tokens as payout. In the morning the tokens were worth thousands and the discord and Telegram chat was filled with fanatics and by evening it was down to less than $100 with half the crowd crying foul and the other crying patience. A rug pull later saw those PolyFox tokens become utterly worthless with most people losing thousands and some, much more. Then the chats became very dark indeed. Lucky for me I did not spend money on the platform, I merely farmed one of their farms with a token pair which yielded me PolyFox that went from worth something to worth nothing in only a few days. The devs who made it got millions and now live lives of luxury. Example 2) Dollar Protocol, part 1, on the Ethereum blockchain was an algorithmically backed stable coin project created by anonymous devs with some projected to be Merlin himself. Shilled by Twitter bignames like DCFGod and the like. The project started out great with yields in the hundreds pf % which paid out GAIA which could be redeemed into ETH but as the protocol increased in movers the price of GAIA began to climb which made it much more profitable to hold GAIA and SHARE and to farm the GAIA SHARE pools instead of SHARE/ETH or ETH/USDC instead of getting rid of the GAIA. The first day I made thousands and the second day when the whales arrived and sucked out all the liquidity the price of GAIA nose dived and the protocol locked certain withdrawals leading to more than ten thousand in losses as the protocol death spiraled after the peg was lost and not regained. Expensive lesson. Example 3) Dollar Protocol part 2 - The dev team came back with another version supposed to fix the issues which led to the demise of the first. New parameters were set and blah blah blah. Also, to help be equitable, the protocol agreed to buy back GAIA at 500:1 but when the new protocol opened and the people who bought billions of GAIA in the previous version all came to redeem their worthless GAIA the protocol again crashed as the new GAIA became worthless, this time in only a day. Lost nothing from the sidelines, learned a great deal more. Example 4) ALICE - Alice is a virtual metaworld on the Binance Smart Chain which is basically a clumsy 3D game of nothingness so far as I can tell but it had a lot of fan fare and some attention from well knowns and so I figured out when the IPO was going to be on some day back some months ago around 4am in the morning EST. I was ready to go on Binance to buy as soon as the timer clicked 0 but when it did the channel was immediately congested with auto-buying bots which drove the price from 6$ to over $40 in less than three seconds. Of course after the initial hype wore off that high of $40 went down to $16 before slowly falling further to wherever it is currently. Lesson learned there too - the individual user will never gain entry that way without bots or other highly technical mechanisms. A new project is extremely volatile the first few hours/days with the price using going quite high and then falling precipitously in a sell-off only to restabilize before gradually falling to a baseline. If you can time that baseline and get in there, that is when you are early. Example 5) Titan - Titan was another algo stable coin which death spiraled magnificently losing its bag holders hundreds of millions of dollars in mere minutes. The line up was an almost perfect slope of 2 until just like a ruler drew it the price went from over 1.30 to less than 50 cents when one of the whales liquidated everything. The two days previous the prices was moving up constantly and then BOOM! The hammer drops. You could see over the course of those two days hose whispers of Titans became all over the feed as more and more minnows dived into the pool before the whales pulled plug. Now there are new projects coming and going all the time. Six months ago there were 6500 projects listed on CoinGecko and today there are over 11000. If you do not know what you are doing you will get burned more often than you will not. DYOR and find projects you understand, that have real world use case, and depending on your level of risk, a market cap above a certain amount (anything less than 2 billion is risky, anything less than 50 million is very high risk). Remember, Monero (XMR) is the only token accepted on many of the largest dark web markets which do hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions per day - THAT is real world use case. Find that or similar projects with real value and you should do alright as long as you plan your investment well. DYOR.",

      "BTC and ETH rising is not so surprising. It is a lot like the last emissions of a dying ember before it cools to ash. The only reason I can give to why Ethereum is the blockchain with ridiculous high gas fees and transaction failures. If you are already rich, then you don't care because it still does magic, just very high priced magic. The other blockchains with ridiculously low gas fees and near instant transaction fees are going to eat Ethereum's patrician lunch in 2022 and beyond as new investors pile into their competitors. IF you want to make a lot of money in crypto then pick a top 10 blockchain, buy as much as you can afford to lose, and just keep it for a minimum of six months. Two to three years is probably the max. This space moves too fast to fall in love, except my hypocritical love for Monero (XMR) of course which, in five years time I believe will be the world's bitcoin. It's already the blackmarket (darkwebs) token of choice - how do you think BTC got started?Buying Monero right now, today, at $250 is like buying BTC back when it was $250. Out of the over 10,600 listed crypto projects, it is my favorite. My investment strategy? Invest in FTM (got in around .40) and ride it up to $6-8$ while also using their primo DeFi protocol SpiritSwap to farm my FTM for SPIRIT which in time will be worth +1$ if not much more. I got in at .02. Once I reach those levels with this specific investment then I would liquidate and buy as much Monero as I could afford (which is already contained in my portfolio) and then sit on that until winds change or the destination is reached. Of course this is just one investment - I also very much like Secret Network (SCRT) and also Stacks (STX). Notice the MC of each project is below 6 billion. Each will reach 50+ billion or more EASY in the next year or two barring a world conflict or outright banning by the worlds largest and most powerful governments. Barring anything like that, then DeFi will explode in the nexrt few years and those projects and many more like them (SOL, DOT, ADA, RUNE, LUNA, ATOM, AVAX, FTM, SCRT) and probably more blockchains as well as their protocols and DEX/DeFi platforms will evaluate to tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars. If you want to invest, picking one of the blockchain projects listed above (especially low MC like ATOM, FTM, SCRT, RUNE) would be a pretty safe pick for 2022. DYOR. ",

      "When writing or initializing a transaction, you have to pay for the transaction to be written to the blockchain. To make this work, you need to pay gas which is the fee, or price, required to successfully conduct a transaction and execute a contract on the blockchain. As long as you are only reading from the blockchain and not changing or updating anything, you don't need to carry out a transaction and there will be no gas or cost to do so.  - so in layman’s terms, you can look but not touch. Currently, Ethereum is the most invested blockchain per market cap (MC) with many others nearing towards the 100 billion dollar mark (Cardano(ADA), Solana(SOL), Polkadot(DOT) and still others chasing up from a not so distant tail like Terra (LUNA), Avalanche (AVAX) or even Fantom (FTM)). Each blockchain does the same thing, creates an immutable ledger, but how those inputs (transactions) are made into the ledger and what sort of infrastructure can be built on top (and how) is what makes each chain different. It is highly unlikely a single chain will reign dominant - there will always be a place for Dr. Pepper compared to Coke and Pepsi. Ethereum is, like Bitcoin, archaic compared to many of its younger and more robust peers. The MC in ETH and BTC is mostly due new investors and large investment funds being managed by risk-averse centric-minded managers who are unwilling to accept larger risk or ignorant to the other products/services elsewhere or a combination of both which, to be fair, can be hard to keep up with given the blistering pace of development and ever increasing amount of projects (ring 'carrying capacity'). For example, Ethereum's gas fees as spoken about at top of message are magnitudes higher than Fantom's and yet Fantom has a MC of 6 billion and ETH closer to 500 billion. Not to carry FTM's water, because AVAX is even faster, but FTM and AVAX transaction  confirm (that means they are written to the blockchain) in a seconds time or less and for fractions of a cent compared to Ethereum which can take many minutes and sometimes cost upwards of 100 hundred dollars in times of high volume for each transaction (TX). The way that Ethereum was built means it is not simply a matter of making a few patches and fixing their exorbitant high gas fees and long block transaction times. That is why their layer 2 upgrade has been years in the making and still not implemented fully. Remember, Ethereum is the first blockchain just like Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency. This is why so many other blockchains like Solana and Polkadot are quickly eating up market share and why, at least in the short to mid term, better returns should be expected with investing in such projects - especially low MC projects with high upside like AVAX, POLY and FTM and even LUNA still. Each block chain has their own projects, Dapps and DEX's, DAO's, ect. Ethereum has SushiSwap and UniSwap while Fantom has SpiritSwap and SpookySwap. You can bridge between chains and access each chains specific projects directly and then either hold the tokens or utilize them in one of the myriad DeFi protocols such as yields farming to gain large (+20%) yields on your farmed assets. Bitcoin has a reason to keep accruing in value because real nation states have adopted its use as a legal currency. Ethereum has much less reason to continue accruing in value. Both projects are mostly riding on their names alone at this point as each is easily outdone by competitors such as Monero for Bitcoin and again, Fantom for Ethereum. However, the situation is different for Bitcoin and Ethereum and Ethereum is facing much stiffer competition from many more sides than is bitcoin. The other chains with better transaction times, lower fees, and the same or better services will continue to eat away at Ethereum MC - however, the crypto space is still new and if mass adoption takes hold while Ethereum is still in the top spot then even with its worse technology it would most likely remain dominant and see far higher prices than it is at currently. Still, personally, I would not invest in ETH at these prices since if mass adoption did come there would be significant overflow into the smaller projects which gain in value much faster and with less capital required than either of the two old behemoths that are BTC and ETH. Again though, with the Taproot upgrade and lightening network and other ecosystems being built around BTC it could very well see it’s best days ahead. DYOR.",

      "Bitcoin at 59,000 is not a downturn. Sell pressure creates further sell pressure and media survives off advertisements. New money in the market spooks a lot easier than old money which got in low. There is always a chance that the markets could suddenly correct deeply. The mob is ignorant and fickle or else how could DOGE and SHIBA ever be top 10 projects? However, most of the mob are poor, silly and inconsequential. At this point, with all of the infrastructure, acceptance, investment and use of crypto by the consequential a collapse to 0 like the apt referred to 'Tulip bonanza' is simply not possible. Sure, eventually their will be a large culling of the herd and it is possible that this could be the beginning of a cull but fundamentally there is no reason for that to happen currently. The mob could, perhaps, cause a down turn but the institutional investors, corporations and even nation states will step in to buy all the discounted assets that the plebs sold in their unfounded hysteria. Each person's risk and portfolio are different and nothing in crypto is set in stone except that it is here to stay. Last note - when the markets are hot you would do well to take out profits and sit on them in a stable coin until dips/depressions then buy more of what you like during the discounts. That is how you increase your standings. Still bullish but media + mob hysterics/fear mongering could cause further down turn, even though fundamentally there is no good reason why the markets should. However, there is no good reason why DOGE was ever a top 10 project and yet, there it is. Both the power and imbecility of the mob shown clear in one example. Three months from now? Six months? Bitcoin may still be where it is but many other projects will be much higher. The ecosystem is still in the creation stage awaiting it's first mass extinction event which the exponential growth curve will eventually cause. DYOR.",

      'How to protect your crypto wealth: When you are in the market and feel as though a down turn is starting or imminent (neither of which I believe currently) then you have multiple options, some better than others. a) Swap your volatile tokens into stable coins like DAI, USDT, UST, USDC, ect ect which are all backed by the US dollar and pegged to a 1:1 ration. The quick amongst you may be saying that those choices are hardly stable since the dollar is inflating so quickly. This is why the best stable coins are the ones backed by gold, silver, palladium, or other globally recognized precious metals. There are certain coins like PAX gold for example where 1 PAX coin is equal to 1 Troy OZ of gold which actually exist and can be verified or redeemed at anytime. b) Swap your tokens back into FIAT. If you are registered through your banks with over restrictive big brother-esque governments then this will most likely result in significant taxes being assessed. If however you are trading anonymously then the issue still persist and is not easily solved currently in most places outside of finding someone to swap you FIAT for crypto, a dubious preposition at times. c) Use your crypto to purchase assets of worth such as gold, silver, land, art, or other collectibles. The issue here is taxes and fees as well as the difficulty of liquidating your purchased assets (ever tried to sell large amounts of gold in a short amount of time without being utterly ripped off like a pawn shop customer??? Hardly simple!). d) Leave your 💩 alone. If you invested in real projects (of which most are facades (over 10,700+ projects and counting... Was only 6,600 six months ago... exponential curves cannot last) and wait for the markets to recover. The only people who lost money on buying bitcoin are the ones who sold before the next all time high was reached. With recent upgrades like TapRoot allowing DeFi applications to be built around BTC such as the ecosystem seen with Stacks (STX) means Bitcoin is far from finished - remember less than two months ago El Salvador made Bitcoin LEGAL currency for an entire nation state. Last thought - if you do put all your wealth into stable coins when the market falls you are still risking a lot because everyone else will mostly do the same putting never before seen pressure on those stable coins pegs and if the peg fails (Dollor Protocol cough cough, Titan cough cough) then your wealth will quickly death spiral to nothing. Coins backed by actual metals/commodities would be safer under a crashing market and, given the exponential increase of projects/chains/tokens, the dot.com crash of crypto WILL occur eventually. As always DYOR',

      "Today's crypto pullback is transitory (unlike inflation) and was caused/may continue being caused by a few different factors that, even when summated, give poor cause to exit the markets or sell for losses. A) China again is tightening the noose on crypto in the CCP. Their reasons? Bitcoin mining is bad for the enviornment. I know. How they say such fanciful foolery with a straight face is anyone's guess but needless to say China is a global force now so their decisions can make waves. Far from a tsunami though. Their big break came in May, there's nothing to really see here.😎 Biden signing the infastructure bill into law which included backwards provisions on crypto was another wrinkle delivered by the media today. However those measures wont take effect until at least 2023 and by that time bribes (lobbying) will gave ensured the current legislation is watered down or abandoned. As well as the speed of innovation would circumvent the onerous restrictions anyway. A red herring and nothing else. C) Lastly Twitter refusing to get on board atm with crypto in their books added to the hyperbolic tizzy that saw profit takers removing gains and noobies panic selling for a loss. Still very bullish.Today is a good day to buy, not sell (speaking generally overall). As always, DYOR.",

      "Post 1) If you are interested in investing or already investing into crypto then you should use the correct tools. CNN, Fox News or even Bloomberg do not have what you need. Check out sites like https://www.coindesk.com/ or https://finematics.com/ and stay up to date on the news.The last big crash in May (when BTC was last above $65,000) was caused by the news of China (enemy of the free world) declaring cryptocurrencies to be illegal. At the time, more than half of all Bitcoin being mined were being mined in China as well as the crypto market at large still follows the Bitcoin price index as a general market barometer.So - check the news everyday and look for anything which could or will have short-term negative consequences (or long-term depending) and so be able to gauge market trends before or as they happen instead of after the fact.The recent 'infastructure bill' also contained provisons which, if implemented as written, would have an immediately drastic and chilling effect on the overall market as a whole since now the USA leads the world in Bitcoin mining. However, those provisions are not set to take effect until 2024 by which time our laudable representatives in D.C. or at the treasury departments would have received enough lobbying (read bribes) in order to water down or outright change the recently passed legislation. So try to read deeper into a situation. The day you read China banned crypto when China was leading btc mining would have been a blaring red flag saying sell your non-stable coins into either Fiat, goldsilver, or stable coins. However the recent news regarding legislation not slated to take effect for years - in an industry where years are decades in innovation, is hardly worth breaking a sweat over. Short term, barring any large and coordinated governmental effort (not like Indonesia trying to ban an entire technology on religious grounds) the market looks incredibly strong and flourishing. As always, do your own research. With the new Taproot upgrades that just went into effect this weekend as well as Snatch and ALEX bringing Bitcoin into DeFi I see a lot of new life about to get blown into this otherwise crypto dinosaur. I still love Monero though, but not enough to over invest when other projects are yielding much more in the short term.",
